# ot-profiles
OT Profiles aligned with SEI ETF initiative and IEC 62443-5

This is a set of JSON formatted templates for use in defining an OT profile (e.g. substation, DER, control center, etc) that can be used in modeling engineering risks and controls for critical infrastructure. Initial release October 2022 with updates for planned compatibility with ISA99/IEC 62443 Section 5.

You can select from a list of site defaults in /profiles that includes information on common device type, function and security features based on Purdoe model level that can be programmatically ingested with the provided JSON file.
